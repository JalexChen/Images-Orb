A starter template for orb projects. Build, test, and publish orbs automatically on CircleCI with [Orb-Tools](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/orb-tools).

Additional READMEs are available in each directory.

**Meta**: This repository is open for contributions! Feel free to open a pull request with your changes. Due to the nature of this repository, it is not built on CircleCI. The Resources and How to Contribute sections relate to an orb created with this template, rather than the template itself.

## Resources

[CircleCI Orb Registry Page](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/<namespace>/<project-name>) - The official registry page of this orb for all versions, executors, commands, and jobs described.
[CircleCI Orb Docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/#section=configuration) - Docs for using and creating CircleCI Orbs.

### How to Contribute

We welcome [issues](https://github.com/<organization>/<project-name>/issues) to and [pull requests](https://github.com/<organization>/<project-name>/pulls) against this repository!

### How to Publish
* Create and push a branch with your new features.
* When ready to publish a new production version, create a Pull Request from _feature branch_ to `master`.
* The title of the pull request must contain a special semver tag: `[semver:<segment>]` where `<segment>` is replaced by one of the following values.

| Increment | Description|
| ----------| -----------|
| major     | Issue a 1.0.0 incremented release|
| minor     | Issue a x.1.0 incremented release|
| patch     | Issue a x.x.1 incremented release|
| skip      | Do not issue a release|

Example: `[semver:major]`

* Squash and merge. Ensure the semver tag is preserved and entered as a part of the commit message.
* On merge, after manual approval, the orb will automatically be published to the Orb Registry.

# what jobs do I need to run here?
  # checkout, create a new branch, make updates, push + release
  # i'll need to be able to update the dockerfile-template
  # i'll need to be able to update the config
  # i'll likely need the github cli orb in order to release
  # i'll need to be able to call sonar and/or change the sonar version

  # updates will be an entire job
  # commands will be what runs within the job

# which images will I need to include as part of the updates
# can i potentially run this as a matrix job?

- should be agnostic of repo since it will be run within that repo

Goal will be to make the orb that can be inserted into each config so that we only need to change things in the orb rather than all image repos
- docker image as a variable
- remote docker version as a variable
- flow to build docker images
- flow to deploy
